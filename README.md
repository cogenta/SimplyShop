# Set Up

Simply Shop uses [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install dependencies.

CocoaPods is distributed as a ruby gem, installing it is as easy as running the
following commands in the terminal:

    $ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
    $ pod setup

Now you can install the dependencies in the project:

    $ pod install

Make sure to always open the Xcode workspace instead of the project file:

    $ open App.xcworkspace
